This project aims to contain Objective-C Classes
that come in handy for Haskell Programmers.

Here are some friends of makeObjectsPerformSelector:

// this "function" is different than the built-in
// "makeObjectsPerformSelector:" in the result type
// (NSArray *) instead of (void).
NSArray *results = [someArray mapSel:@selector(someSelector)];

// as you would expect it comes with or without an object as parameter
NSArray *results = [someArray mapSel:@selector(someSelector)
                                 obj:someObject];

// also have it the other way around
NSArray *results = [someObject mapSel:@selector(someSelector)
                                  arr:someArray;

// The enclosing NSArray Category comes with a full load of similar
// "functions" and with the (unjustified) high hopes that you will
// "never" have to write a loop again by hand.

// we can also zip array now
NSArray *zippedArrays = [someArray zip:anotherArray];

NSArray *zippedArrays = [someArray zipWith:@selector(someSelector
                                       arr:anotherArray];
